<h1>About Me</h1>
<p></p>

<p>I am Emre Vurus, 19 years old, and I have been working with software for a while.
  This is my first website, and I live in Izmir.
  I am a university student, developing myself in the field of software, and taking steps toward achieving the projects I aim for.
  This won't be an easy journey, but I am someone who doesn't know how to give up, as I believe in the philosophy that those who give up are the ones who lose in life. 
  I am confident that I will leave my mark on the future with steady progress. 
  On this path, I am moving forward with the support of my mentors and peers, developing projects together. 
  To summarize briefly, this is who I am.
